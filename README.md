# Epitech Workshop: Mastering RadioFrance API and GraphQL

## Overview

This workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of working with the RadioFrance API, and using GraphQL for efficient data querying.

## Objectives

1. **Mastering the Basics of GraphQL**: This workshop will delve into the fundamentals of GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs. Participants will be guided on how to construct queries to retrieve specific data.

2. **Working with RadioFrance's OpenAPI**: Participants will gain practical experience with the OpenAPI provided by RadioFrance. This OpenAPI, not to be confused with the OpenAPI standard, allows users to get access to the program grid for all the group's stations in a programmatic manner (e.g. knowing which program is playing at a given time on a given station), including information on the stations, shows, and podcasts.

3. **Hackathon Readiness**: This workshop is designed to equip participants with the necessary understanding and skills to efficiently engage with the RadioFrance API and implement GraphQL in their applications. This knowledge will be particularly beneficial for the imminent hackathon, where participants will be tasked with developing an application that leverages the RadioFrance API.
